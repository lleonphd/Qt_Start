# Qt_Start

Please read the tutorial for a concise summary. 

This "project" is intended to give you a starter template with some initial UI features self-organized by Qt. I like this because it largely removes the UX development (i.e., where to put buttons, how big they should be, do I need to resize my grid layout, etc.) so you can concentrate on the code development. If you need to add a button, then you can do this by adding it as code rather than adding a button-image in a UI/UX designer tool. Qt will automatically resize the GUI for you. 

In short, I use this as a ready-made GUI for quick code testing. This way I spend near-zero time with building the UI/UX.

If you need to build the project on a different machine, all you need to do is copy the file to a different machine, delete the pro.user file and rebuild.
