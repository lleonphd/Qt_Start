This tutorial was done using Qt Creator running on Ubuntu 10.10

The pdf contains "print-screens" of code. 

the "actual" code (i.e., header and cpp files) corresponding to the "print-screens" are named accordingly in this folder. 

Most of the code developed and compiled to run hardware in the telerobotics lab is based on Qt's signals-and-slots framework. If you are used to Visual Studio, Qt's signals-and-slots framework takes some time getting used to.

I created this tutorial to provide an easy-to-use starter template with some initial UI features so that you can quickly connect your C/C++ code to those UI features.
